## Future directions for compendium

+ Automated retrieval and integration of newly deposited SRA RNA-seq datasets into compendium
+ Integration with long read technologies, including direct RNA sequencing
+ Searchability -- sketches enable searchable database to quickly return experiments that are most similar to a new query experiment

## Future uses for compendium/research enabled

A recurrent theme across previously generated compendia is the idea that a compendium and any published analyses applied to it should act as "launching pads" [quoted from TCGA value] for continued analysis of those data products, or that new analyses could act as rapid and resource-conserving hypothesis-generating steps for new research.
The compendia themselves become annotated resources that help define current blind spots in biology, helping to better distribute research resources to tackle those blind spots [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2018.03.042]

+ Transfer learning
+ Generation of co-expression networks
