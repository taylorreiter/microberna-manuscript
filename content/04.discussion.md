## Future directions for compendium

+ Automated retrieval and integration of newly deposited SRA RNA-seq datasets into compendium
+ Integration with long read technologies, including direct RNA sequencing
+ Searchability -- sketches enable searchable database to quickly return experiments that are most similar to a new query experiment

## Future uses for compendium/research enabled

+ Transfer learning
+ Generation of co-expression networks
